Data Science Insurance Cost Project
Overview
This project analyzes and predicts insurance costs using a dataset containing demographic and health-related information. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate insurance charges based on features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.
Project Structure
Data Science insurance cost project.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing all data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps.
Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
age: Age of the primary beneficiary
sex: Gender of the beneficiary
bmi: Body Mass Index
children: Number of children covered by health insurance
smoker: Smoking status (yes/no)
region: Residential area in the US
charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
Workflow
Data Loading & Exploration
Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Visualize distributions and relationships between features and the target variable (charges).
Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (if any).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., sex, smoker, region).
Feature scaling as needed.
Model Building
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
Results & Interpretation
Analyze feature importance.
Visualize predictions vs. actual values.
Discuss findings and potential improvements.
